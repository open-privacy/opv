Planes are separated entrypoints and ports to access different segments of OPV.
Currently OPV is planning to support the following planes:

- Control Plane
- Data Plane
- Proxy Plane (TODO)

## Control Plane

Control plane (`default port: 27999`) is a group of controllers that handle the admin related logic.
In your network, you should do your best to isolate the access to the control plane.

Control plane securely manages the following data models:

- `Grant`
- `Grant Token`
- `Grant Permissions`

## Data Plane

Data plane (`default port: 28000`) is a group of controllers that handle the crud logic related to
PII information.

Data plane securely manages the following data models:

- `Scope`
- `Fact`
- `Fact Types`

## Proxy Plane (TODO)

Proxy plane will handle multiple protocols' (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, and etc.) requests and responses rewrite on-the-fly with PII tokenization rules.
