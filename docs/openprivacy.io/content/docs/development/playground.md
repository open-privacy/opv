## Data Plane Demo

Playground demo of tokenization and detokenization via the Data Plane: `https://playground.openprivacy.io`.

- For tokenization, we are using a public OPV grant token that's only writtable to data plane's `/js/v1/facts` route.
- For detokenization, we are using a private OPV grant token that's only readable to data plane's `/api/v1/facts/*` route. Note that we highly recommend one **don't expose** the token with read permissions to the public JavaScript client. This detokenization is for demo purposes only.

## Proxy Plane Demo

Playground demo of sending API requests to Checkr via the Proxy Plane: `proxy-playground.openprivacy.io`.

- The definition of the proxy routing can be found at [opv-proxyplane-http.example.json](https://github.com/roney492/opv/blob/53eb70c1ce9aaaa897863982efb468df487ce7c0/cmd/proxyplane/opv-proxyplane-http.example.json#L105).
- We simulated that once the internal system have tokenzied `facts` (i.e. sensitive PIIs), it can talks to a dedicated proxy plane route for automated detokenization when sending the requests to external vendors like [Checkr API](https://api.checkr.com).
- You can also inspect the network requests directly from your browser (tldr - press `F12`) to check the actual payload.
